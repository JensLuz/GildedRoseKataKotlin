This project contains the Gilded Rose Kata in Kotlin.
The following steps were executed to refactor the project:
- Fixed the unit test coverage including all known requirements
- Split up the monolithic function into smaller functions
- Replaced nested if's into functions for better readability
- Reduced curly bracket overhead of the if's by one-liners
- Reduced counter overhead by using the short notations += and -=
- Included comments in the code
